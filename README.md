# pointfree_pokemon_kata

Note: the Point-Free Pokemon Kata was first used for the #ramdajs session @ #socrates16

Purpose
-------
Use this Kata as an exercise for the Point-Free-Programming style in JavaScript. You will need a Functional Programming library to perform this kind of programming style in JS. Imho Ramda (http://ramdajs.com/) is currently the best option.

Dependencies
------------
Included in the Repository is the Jasmine-Testing Framework and the functional programming library Ramda.


How to use the Kata:
--------------------
Just open the SpecRunner.html in a browser. It runs the unit tests/specs. Your goal are to 

 1. Fix the spec "Pokemon-Kata should find the nearest distance to a Pokemon of type 'Normal"
 2. Write the body of the pending spec "Pokemon-Kata should find the name of the nearest Pokemon of type 'Normal'" and provide a working implementation
 
You can use the prepared functions "x", "y", "square" and "distance". You don't need to touch the specs for distance and square. They are just here for information/completeness.
